cderpm
======

RPM spec file, patches, and scripts to package up the Common Desktop
Environment.

The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) from The Open Group is now available
under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later (LGPLv2+).
The project can be found here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/

This project is an RPM spec file and related files used to build an
installable CDE package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Linux
systems.


TARGET PLATFORMS
----------------

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (x86_64)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (x86_64)
CentOS 7 (x86_64)
CentOS 6 (x86_64)
Fedora 27 (x86_64)
Fedora 28 (x86_64)
Fedora rawhide (x86_64)

I may not have all platforms building at a given time, which is why I refer to
them as targets rather than requirements.  I'm always interested in patches to
get things building and packaging on other Red Hat-derived distributions.


AVAILABILITY
------------

Builds are done using the COPR infrastructure in the Fedora Project.  Users
of RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora can enable the 'cde' copr repository and then
install the 'cde' package using yum or dnf:

    dnf copr enable dcantrel/cde
    dnf install cde

Older systems using yum may have slightly different steps to enable the
repo.  If you figure that out, please let me know so I can add it to the
README file.
